# SPACEMAN👽


SPACEMAN is a word game derived from the widely popular game *"HANGMAN"*, in which one player thinks of a random word, and the other player has to identify this word by guessing which letters they believe are included in the word. For every incorrect guess, a new part is added to the picture of the hanging man until it is complete, in which case, the guessing player has lost.

In this version of the game, the word will be selected by the computer, as well as a hint to aid the player in guessing. Seeing as how hanging is a capital punishment in certain cultures, SPACEMAN was designed to be a more appropriate version of the game, replacing the image of the hanging man with one of a cartoon spaceship.
